# RNA-seq analysis of IAPV and diet in Apis Mellifera

This repository consists of materials for an RNA-seq study that examined IAPV inoculation and monofloral diet quality factors in honeybees. Below is an outline of the analysis scripts, data files, and text files that can found in this repository.

**Folders containing analysis scripts and data files:** 

  * **C_R:** Analysis scripts for the diet effect in our study (Castanea versus Rockrose)
  * **Galbraith:** Analysis scripts for the virus effect in a prior study by [Galbraith et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004713)
  * **NC_NR_VC_VR:** Analysis scripts for pairwise comparisons for both diet ad virus factors in our study
  * **N_V:** Analysis scripts for the virus effect in our study (Non-infection versus infection)
  * **Overlaps:** Analysis scripts for determining DEG overlaps between various pipelines (DESeq2, edgeR, limma) and our study versus the Galbraith study
  * **Physiology:** Data and analysis scripts for mortality rate and IAPV titer loads in a prior study by Dolezal et al.
  * **PostHocDEGPatterns:** Analysis scripts for post-hoc analysis of physiology correlations in DEG patterns
  * **ResistanceTolerance:** Analysis scripts for resistance and tolerance candidate Genes
  * **Tissues:** Analysis scripts for estimating tissue expression in DEGs (not included in our manuscript)
  * **Variables.csv:** Physiology metrics for the honeybees used in this RNA-seq study
  
**Folder contaning reproducible scripts related to our manuscript:**

There is a folder called **Manuscript**, which contains materials related to a manuscript we are preparing for this work. This directory contains the following materials:

  * **AdditionalFiles:** The supplementary files in our manuscript (n=19)
  * **Figures:** The figures in our manuscript (n=6)
  * **MakeFiguresFiles:** Reproducible scripts for recreating the figures and supplementary (additional) files. We are still working on this directory
  * **Text:** Files for creating our manuscript. Our latest manuscript text is located in the file called **manuscript.tex**
